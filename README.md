UX
This is a business to business web site designed to target Industrial boiler companies. They will see what special training we can offer that will benefit their
business going forward. 
To give the user the best possible experience, I have carefully selected a veriety of relevant pictures for each section. The home page and the Training courses page
have full background pictures. This adds to the visual aesthetics of the design.

User Stories

Boilertec(Scotland)LTD
We are an Industrial and Commercial boiler company. We require specific training for our operatives. We found the IBTC site on the web, and have used it every
time we need specific training. We find the site very easy to navigate. The Information is all there, and the pictures make the experience plesurable.
It is very easy to select the courses you are interested in, and register your details.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

Testing
I have tested the register Form. If you try to submit the Form with any of the fields blank it will ask you to fill them in. A valid email address also must be entered.
I have tested the Training Courses form. All the individual courses retutn the correct values.
When I tested on differentscreen sizes I had a problem with the Controls, Burners and Steam Boiler pages. I had to re design these pages to allow them to display on 
smaller screen sizes. I have re tested all the screen sizes to make sure it displays correct.

Deployment
I deployed my project on github pages.
