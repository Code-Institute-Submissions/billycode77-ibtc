The home page give a brief description of the company history, brief details of the courses, and the company contact list. There is a menu in the header. It allows you
to select Controls,Burners, Steam Boilers or Training courses.
The Controls, Burners and Steam boiler pages are set out in 5 columns . Each column give a list of what topics are covered in the courses, with a visual image or
 picture above the heading.
The training course page is split in to 3 columns. The first one you can register your details. The second on you can select the courses that you are interested in.

UX
This is a business to business web site designed to target Industrial boiler companies. They will see what special training we can offer that will benefit their
business going forward. 
To give the user the best possible experience, I have carefully selected a veriety of relevant pictures for each section. The home page and the Training courses page
have full background pictures. This adds to the visual aesthetics of the design.

User Stories

Boilertec(Scotland)LTD
We are an Industrial and Commercial boiler company. We require specific training for our operatives. We found the IBTC site on the web, and have used it every
time we need specific training. We find the site very easy to navigate. The Information is all there, and the pictures make the experience plesurable.
It is very easy to select the courses you are interested in, and register your details.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

Features

All The pictures we from Google, by searching "Industrial boiler pics", "Steam boiler pics", "Boiler controls pics" and "Industrial Burner pics"
I looked back at previous videos from the Code institute course, and modified the code to suit my web design.

Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
